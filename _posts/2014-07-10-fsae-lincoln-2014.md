## About this post

This is a test post. It's in the `_posts` directory.

## Site Demo

### Code
Jekyll highlights code _automatically!_

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

The competition has a page [on the SAE website](http://students.sae.org/cds/formulaseries/west/).

This website also has _cutting-edge_ **text formatting** _**technology**_ <u>which lets you use underline, <strong>bold, <em>and italics at the same time.</em></strong></u>

### Lists

#### Bullets

- Hello world!
- Here is a long item in that list. <mark>Here is a long item in that list.</mark> Here is a long item in that list. Here is a long item in that list. Here is a long item in that list. Here is a long item in that list. Here is a long item in that list. 

#### We can also do numbered lists.

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Sponsors are the backbone of our organization --- they make the racecar possible. From their advice to their financial support, our sponsors go above and beyond to support this project.

From Fortune 500 companies to local organizations, Knickerbocker Motorsports is proud to recognize a diverse and responsible group of sponsors. Our sponsors are an integral part of the team. They provide design advice, materials, and critical financial support. In return for their generosity, we proudly display our sponsors' logos at our on-campus events, on our website, and at our booth at the [New York International Auto Show](http://www.autoshowny.com/), the largest attended show in the country. 

For more information on sponsorships, please feel free to [contact us]({{ "/contact/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) directly.

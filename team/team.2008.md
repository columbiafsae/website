## Car 83

This was a very exciting year. The team made its best showing to date at the 2008 competition. The car was ready to go well before competition, leaving a decent testing period. The car was good to go for the competition right out of the truck, and there were no problems to speak of the entire event. The car ran in every dynamic event, and we were one of only 40 teams to complete the endurance event.

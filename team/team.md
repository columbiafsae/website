## Our Vision

As members of Knickerbocker Motorsports, we aim not only to build the most competitive racecar possible, but also to create friendships, connections, memories, and character. 

We work to create an environment that encourages learning, excellence, and mutual respect. One in which anyone, regardless of skill level, can contribute and feel appreciated. Through our racecar, we teach ourselves engineering and project management skills that will serve us well no matter what our future careers turn out to be.

We believe that we have a responsibility to give back to our community through outreach programs that expose children to engineering. 

We are always improving. We are confident that, one day, our team will place in the top ten of the Formula SAE competition.

## Join

The team holds brief planning meetings on Wednesday nights, and meets more extensively for shop days on Fridays. In addition, older members hold workshops, teaching you everything you need to know about building a racecar.

## Car 91

Car 91 was built on the solid designs and success of the 2008 car. The CFR-09 was 50 pounds lighter and had substantially improved suspension and handling characteristics. This car was by far the best looking of any of Columbia's cars to date. The car encountered some small technical difficulties near the end of the endurance event. However, the team realized that with a little more work, they could easily be competing with the most experienced and well-funded teams at the competition.
